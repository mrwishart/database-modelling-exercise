# Database Modelling Homework 

Week 3, Day 2 Homework at CodeClan. Original brief:

## Modelling exercise

Your task is to model *one* of the following:
- Netflix
- Instagram
- BBC News Website

Think about what database tables this site would need, and what relationships they would have to each other. Are they one-to-one, one-to-many, or many-to-many?

You should have at least 5 tables represented in your diagram. But don't go crazy. Simplify, make an MVP of your chosen site.

You can just draw your diagrams and/or notes with pen and paper (take a photo for your repo). Alternatively you can use a tool like draw.io and submit the diagram you make. 

### DO NOT actually make the database / site
